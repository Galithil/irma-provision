# TODO: Might want to download GATK-bundle from https://www.broadinstitute.org/gatk/guide/article.php?id=1215
# Though unclear what versions we need. Use those referenced already in globalConfig.sh? 
# Manually downloading gatk_bundle/2.8/ from proj/a2009002/ on nestor for now, and 
# putting directly on the path that needs syncing. 
# Many of those are symlinks to /data/uppnex/reference though... 

# FIXME: hg19 was empty though. Needs to fetch from somewhere else. 
# Only downloaded b37 from nestor. Got permission denied on some files though. E.g.
