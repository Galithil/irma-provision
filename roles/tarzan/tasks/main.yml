# This is an ugly hack that sets the permissions correctly to g+rwX,o+rX
# for all files that is owned by the current user that is running the playbook. 
# This is necessary because some of the "luarocks install" and "make install" 
# commands run in this role doesn't seem to pick up on the correct umask for
# some weird reason.
#
# Note that this by purpose will miss changing the permissions of files
# owned by an other user, as we do not want to have the playbook cluttered
# with a lot of errors when the permission change fails.
#
# It is therefore expected that this script will always be run when someone is 
# running the role.
